            Nakuja project is a student-driven project. Most of the students
            come from Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture And Technology
            (JKUAT). There are also students from other universities, such as
            Kenyatta University and Dedan Kimathi University of Technology.

          <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-500">
            The best way to catch up with the team is to join the internship
            program. In 2024, we will offer the internship for 12 weeks from
            January to April. We will offer another batch from May to September
            2024 for the same 12 weeks.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-500">
            The internship program is open to all students in Kenya, but we need
            commitment for the whole period. This is not suitable for the
            students who intend to just fulfill the requirements for their
            curriculum. It is an intensive program, and the participants will
            learn a lot from interacting with the other participants.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-500">
            The students are also expected to learn by themselves actively. We
            recommend the participants will acquire the following skills through
            the program.
